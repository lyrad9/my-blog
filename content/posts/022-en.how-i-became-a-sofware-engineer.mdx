We all have our own story of how we became developers. I decided to share this experience with you.

## My First Steps
Since I was little, I was someone who loved to draw; I liked everything related to design. So, at 17, I quickly developed a passion for **graphic design** and started learning it with software like **Photoshop** and later **Illustrator**. I was really fascinated by what these programs could do. Then, while randomly browsing websites on the internet, I thought: **Wow ðŸ¤©!** This is so beautiful! I want to do the same.

## My Training
I started like most people when they begin programming, learning **HTML** and **CSS**. The joy I felt when I wrote my first line of code ðŸ¤£. But I found that I wasn't making progress because I wasn't really following any structured training. I was watching videos here and there on how to do this, how to do that. I ended up memorizing lines of code instead of understanding them. I wanted to create a wow effect rather than understand what I was doing. This became very complicated later when I started with JavaScript. In the end, I had no foundation in JavaScript, and due to a machine problem, I stopped coding ðŸ˜ž. At the beginning of my first university year, when I was 19, I started coding again, beginning with the [HTML/CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y80juYcu3ZI&list=PLwLsbqvBlImHG5yeUCXJ1aqNMgUKi1NK3) course by [Pierre Giraud](https://www.pierre-giraud.com/) and then his [JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZLflMqC6dI&list=PLwLsbqvBlImFB8AuT6ENIg-s87ys4yGWI) course, which gave me a solid foundation ðŸ™‚. I learned [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [VB.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/csharp/), [Java](https://www.java.com/fr/), all within the school framework. But my choice quickly leaned towards JavaScript because of its syntax and how people appreciated this language. Then, thanks to a [developer](https://samuelpokam.com) like you and me, I discovered [React](https://react.dev/) and then [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I really loved how applications are built with this technology, and I continue to learn through many YouTube videos, including those by [Melvynx](https://www.youtube.com/@melvynxdev). It's been two years today that I've been using it, and I really enjoy it because you can do both front-end and back-end.

## My Challenges
Currently, I am learning [Spring Boot](https://start.spring.io/), which is a popular **Java** framework, and I think that soon I will be using it in my projects and creating articles about it. I plan to create **best-selling quality courses** on Next.js and many other technologies by the end of this year to provide people with access to quality content and help them avoid making the same mistakes I did.

## My Advice
If you've read this article and want to become a developer or already are one, hereâ€™s what I can advise you:
- **Stay updated on technology:** Keep an eye on trends in development.
- **We learn every day:** So don't be afraid to learn even from someone younger than you.
- **Work on projects,** even if they are very small; this will help you quickly improve your skills.
- **Follow quality training** that will give you a solid foundation in programming.

## Conclusion
I can say today that I am halfway to what I can achieve as a developer; I keep learning just like you. Give yourself the means to become one; failure is not an option.

See you for the next article ðŸ’»ðŸš€.
